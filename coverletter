HI! My name is Aleksei Melezhik. I am experienced system architect with a solid infrastructure
past.

I have a strong skills on system design, platform engineering and devops methodologies.

I have successfully built a huge number of production ready internal and external products,
working closely with developers team, system analyst, product owners and QA.

I can find a reasonable balance between implementation cost and flexibility.

I have a broad knowledge of today's best practices and IT technologies.

My solid devops and infrastructure focus background help me to build systems with operation cost in mind.

My vast developers experience let me design systems with ability to go deep and
articulate implementation details with developers when required.

My opensource enthusiasm let me see when and where to add established open source technologies
to enterprise IT landscape eliminating maintenance risks.

I am looking forward to work with customers and help them to enable their success through
the story of our win/win cooperation and keep learning throughout this journey.
